# Tim Berners-Lee

> Godfather of the Internet

---

## Early life

Tim Berners-Lee was born in June 1955 in London England as the eldest son in a family of 4. At a young age Tim was exposed to the world of
computer science, both of his parents worked on the first commercial computer the Ferrari Mark 1. Between his parents and his model railways
Tim became avidly interested in electronics in a time when computers and computer science was on the rise. He studied at the Queen's College,
Oxford where he received a bachelors in Physics.

After finishing college Berners-Lee worked as an engineer at the Plessey telecommunications company. Plessey would later be taken over by Siemens in the early 90's. After leaving Plessey he worked as an independent contractor at CERN, while here he proposed the concept of hypertext, the precursor to HTML and later HTML5, the markup language that drives the web today. Initially hypertext was seen as a way to share information amongst researchers of the time. ENQUIRE was the initial prototype for this.

## Career and Research

After leaving CERN Berners-Lee worked in Image Computer Systems in Bournemouth, Dorset. This gave him the experience in computer networking that would help lay the groundwork for his involvement in the creation of the internet as we know it today.

In 1989, as CERN had grown into the largest node in Europe, Berners-Lee saw an opportunity to marry his hypertext idea with the current internet (ARPANET). In his own opinion he "Created the web really in an act of desperation" as without it the documentation systems were having more and more difficulty communicating in differing formats and designs.

Initially his proposal was considered vague, but after using his prototype ENQUIRE and used it to construct the first Web browser, an editor and the first Web server all at once. Its interesting to note that this combination was considered integral to what the world wide web was supposed to be, an open ane collaborative ecosystem where every browser was a WYSIWYG editor (What you see is what you get) and every page was open to be changed and contributed to. A very different vision to the passive windows that we work with today.

The first website was built shortly after at [info.cern.ch](https://info.cern.ch) with the first webpage at [http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html]( http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html). This site centered around teaching users of the WWW how to create their own pages and about the people involved in the creation of the project. Unfortunately the original page no longer exists.

## Continued Contributions

Berners-Lee has in the modern day become the front face for the internet and is credited by many with its creation. He has remained active in the area of data protection, promotion of a more open web and as a key figure in pushing for technology to advance. He as lead an initiative with the UK government on the [data.gov.uk](https://data.gov.uk) open data initiative which intends to publish all data acquired for official purposed for free re-use.

He also launched the World Wide Web Foundation which pushes to give connect the remaining 50% of the world still not online, and to provide a web worth connecting to.

He has been a considerable voice in favour of net neutrality. Net neutrality is quickly becoming a huge issue in the modern landscape as both governments and ISP's are attempting to take what is considered by many, a fundamental right to the access information that the internet provides. He sees the problem of net neutrality as a threat to the original vision of the internet as an open and collaborative body driven to better those who have access to it, and any invasion of this either due to cost or lack of privacy as an issue. This theme in his continued contributions can be seen further in his involvement in the Alliance for Affordable Internet as a coalition of large technology companies and individuals focused on making net access viable for everyone.

Most recently Burners-lee has become involved in Solid. Solid is a new decentralized web project focused on giving each individual user a true data ownership and allowing connectivity akin to the hopes laid down by the semantic web project. The project is open source and hopes to construct a decentralized peer-to-peer network where each user stores their personal information in a POD, essentially described as a "USB for the internet". The hope is to give users more control over their own data, especially after the data protection scandals of the likes of the cambridge analytic and the Russian involvements in the most recent US elections.

## Closing Statement

Berners-Lee is considered a British cultural icon today and his ongoing commitments to technology, science and social justice surrounding them is a testament to the field of software engineering and computer science as a whole. His story is a brilliant example of how an engineer with the right tools and the right idea can go on to change the world, but perhaps more importantly he shows an example of someone who takes absolute ownership of his work as he fights to see it used to its fullest potential for as many people as possible. People following his example can be seen across the open source ecosystem and we as engineers owe him an astronomical amount.

>He wove and created a mass medium for the 21st century, and has fought more than anyone to keep it open, nonproprietary and free.
